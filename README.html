<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Every man has a goal in life, mine is to drink every energy drink in the
world! </p>
<p>In this process i want to review, categorize and describe every one of
them. The idea is to create a database of all energydrink i ever drunk,
completely with ingredients like caffeine or sugar.</p>
<p>For that i will design a database scheme which can handle my demands, as
well as a web frontend which is able to search through and view the entries
very similar to a cms. Currently there is only a static site generator with
some templates, more will come.</p>
<h2>Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>... that this project is an VERY early stage and i am currently mostly
interested in creating data entries of drinks i drank. Occasionally i will
implement of what i think are "cool" features like a changelog or RSS feed
but do not expect a great deal of changes in a very short timespan. </p>
<p>It would be really really glad if anyone could provide useful informations 
how to make the design for the front page and the single drink pages, 
because i am somewhat retarded in that way.</p>
<p>Even better would be a pull request with fixed css and/or mustache template
files. </p>
<h1>Installation and Usage</h1>
<p>you will need the following things to add new drinks automagically and
generate the database.</p>
<ul>
<li>python 2.6</li>
<li>simplejson (pip install simplejson)</li>
<li>pystashe (Mustache for python), currently a fork which fixes inner
  contexts from http://github.com/rafaelcv/pystache</li>
<li>markdown (pip install markdown) for genrating html from this README</li>
</ul>
<h1>Help me!</h1>
<p>I would be more than glad if something of this project helped you, you may
send me one of the energy drinks i have never drank before ( check db).
Send me a quick mail and we might meet up somewhere here in germany.</p>
