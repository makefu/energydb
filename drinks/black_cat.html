<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Silver bottle with some real cheap label with a panther or something as a logo. This stuff looks real cheap, and well... it is, actually. Some people say it looks like a bottle for car oil...
<h3>Taste</h3>
It is very sparkling at the tongue. The gummy taste is at first very strong, but fades fast. It is like most drinks very sweet. It is totally drinkable.
<h3>Overall</h3>
It tastes ok, it looks cheap and it definitly is some cheap stuff. The ingredients are what most of those discounter drinks are and it totally tastes like one.  In my oppinion, it is some fairly solid energy drink. Try it out, you will not regret it.
<h3>Rating: 7.9 of 10</h3>
