<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in an orange and yellow can with a blue Writing "Ena'O" at the front. A label says "+ Honey" and well, it tastes somewhat close to honey i must say.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It smells like... energy drink? The drink tastes incredibly sweet without any CO2. It is just like when you add honey to water. In addition to that it tastes like plastic, somewhat colse to the taste of Mad Bat energy drink. I cannot really say i like it, but at least it is not as bad as Mad Bat!
<h3>Overall</h3>
All in all i can say it tastes pretty bad, but not too bad. I am pretty disappointed that it does not contain any CO2 even though it comes in a can. The drink might be a lot better if it would contain sparking water. If you like honey juice with a bit of can packaging taste, you will love this drink. The energy drink is right from indonesia and there are 2 more to go. I have really no idea why they would sell an energy drink without CO2... but well, there might be people around which love this kind of drink.
<h3>Rating: 2.2 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Lots of thanks to Misa who brought me this drink from her visit to Indonesia.
