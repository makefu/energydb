<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
This time it is an orange can with a golden star at the front. I guess they wanted to make it look extra juicy by taking bright colors. The front says it got the taste "mango, orange, passion fruit" but in the ingredients 9.4 percent out of the 10 percent juice is from apple and nowhere passion fruit is mentioned... 
<h3>Taste</h3>
It really is incredible what the producer of those drinks can do with 9.4 percent of apple concentrate and some "flavor". Only the aftertaste is somewhat apple'y but at first it really tastes like orange and a little bit mango. Well, it is more like when you never ate orange and mango, how you THINK it might taste like. Because i never  ever tried passion fruit before, i cannot tell if it got any passion fruit flavor at all.Anyway this one is not too bad, i mean, it is sweet as shit, but just a bit sweeter than most energy drinks.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This drink falls under the category "FOR SCIENCE" with it's taste. It really is ok for a juice drink and it got enough caffein to keep you awake. It really is worth a try.
<h3>Rating: 7.0 of 10</h3>
