<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It is a small see-through bottle with a printed black and green label. They got a ASCII-happy smiley in the front. At the inside of the label they got a QR-Code and &quot;1337 is awesome&quot;.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It tastes like Mate-tea with CO2 and sugar. There is another drink, well known in the hacker scene, Club Mate. It tastes much more like the original Mate tea, much more aromatic and tangy. It got few CO2 but tastes pretty good.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This scene drink is driven under the concept of CC-BY-NC-SA. The guys behind 1337mate aim to be the open alternative to club mate. The drink as is tastes somewhat good, much more like mate tea.
<h3>Rating: 8.4 of 10</h3>
