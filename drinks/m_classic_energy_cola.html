<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a silver can with red label and text. It is the same can as the other M Classic drinks just a different color. Again the can is slightly bigger than the normal cans, which is kinda cool in my opinion.
<h3>Taste</h3>
UARGH this smells so weird... EWWW, why do all energy cola mix drinks taste so bad??? It tastes like there are some weird &quot;spices&quot; in this drink, i do not really know why. The after taste is just plain BAD, like cola syrup and energy and spices. In addition, the drink does not have enough CO2, which really sucks.
<h3>Overall</h3>
I am on the quest for the reasonably good tasting cola and energy drink. After this drink, i still am... How is it even possible to fuck up the taste that badly with every cola and energy drink? In the near future i will try it myself, to mix cola and energy. Maybe it is not even possible to mix these two without producing a bad taste? In my next cola/energy drink review i will write my results.
<h3>Rating: 5.0 of 10</h3>

Tribute again goes to Thorsten Schoog!
