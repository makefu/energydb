<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
fire of istanbul comes in a black and red can with white text. It looks like there has not been much effort in designing the can, like &quot;take some long name&quot; and &quot;put it on the can to fill up the whole place&quot;. To top it, use the most basic font in your illustration program, Arial. This design surely cannot convince.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Well, no surprises in smell with this drink. It smells sweet and gummyish. The taste of fire of istanbul probably &quot;should&quot; taste like an ordinary drink but there is definitly something wrong. It almost seems like the after taste is the one of root beer and i hate that stuff! It leaves a thin film in your mouth, like tooth paste.
<h3>Overall</h3>
fire of istanbul tries to be a adequate clone of red bull, probably especially for the turkish market, but fails miserably. I drank better clones for much cheaper. In addition to that the taste is fucked up in some way. If you really lack caffeine and you have the option to get this drink or a cheap coffee, take the second one.
