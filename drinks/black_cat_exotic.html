<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink comes in a purple and pink can with a black panther as the logo. The design looks reaaaaaly cheap to me, especially because "Juicy" is written in a yellow wannabe stylish looking font which really bites with the rest of the design. The "explosion" behind the panther logo also looks totally shitty.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Black Cat Exotic really smells like the Relentless Juicy energy drink. It does not taste like it though. The drink is pretty sour and does not taste like an normal energy drink. It is sweet, a bit like the Fanta soft drink. It surely is quite drinkable. The best thing is simply that it does not suck taste-wise compared to other "Exotic" Energy drinks.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Black Cat Exotic is a spin-off from the Black Cat energy drink. Being sold in a can instead of a cheap plastic bottle it really is somewhat different to the original drink.  The can itself is pretty big though (330ml)! For being a discounter energy this one is really not too bad just as good than the original black cat energy drink.
<h3>Rating: 7.9 of 10</h3>
