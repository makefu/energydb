<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
RedBull Red comes in an all red(surprise!) can with the original blue pull ring of red bull. The text itself is is silver, the color of the aluminium can. The design is pretty minimalistic, fitting into the red bull product line.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Well, i must say after opening it smells fruity in a good way. The taste is berrylike, probably even cranberry as advertised. The typical energy drink taste is only very subtile and not dominant like in most drinks. The overtall taste is a bit too sour but besides that not too shabby. 
<h3>Overall</h3>
So, this is one of the 'new' RedBull /Limited Edition/ drinks. I bought it on the cheap for 1 euro but the original price between 1.50 and 2 euros i think it is definitly overpriced (like most drinks by the way...). In a few weeks we will see if this drink will be pulled from the market or lose its label 'limited edition' and stays in the shelves of your local energy drink dealer. I like the taste but wouldn't buy it again for the recommended retail price.
<h3>Rating: 7.9 of 10</h3>
