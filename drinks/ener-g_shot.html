<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a small plastic bottle with a red cap and a blue label. The shot has a flashy-like silver logo with the red ENER-G text at the front. The shot looks kinda cheap compared to otre shots, but because of being so small the shot drink will not stay on the table for long.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Why cannot they produce a shot drink which actually tastes not like shit? It is ultra sweet at the beginning and then tastes like some kind of medicine against coughing. It really really tastes crappy and your face will go like DX when you drink it. I really hope for this drink to provide some of the good stuff to outdo the incredibly bad taste.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is another of these "shot" drinks and what can i say... the taste was naturally really really bad. I must say i drank that one "not" cold but these shot drinks normally do not have to be cold (according to the commercials). I really hope there is one of these shot drinks which is actually drinkable, but i guess shots taste bad by design...
