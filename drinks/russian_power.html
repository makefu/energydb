<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It's a black can with the russian flag and a warrior with a huge sword at the front. It really looks kinda cool, even though i am pretty sure this energy drink is not actually from Russia
<h3>Taste</h3>
This energy drink tasts really good. Its not too sweet, got this characteristic gummy bear taste and well, you really feel empowered! The whey in it does not have any taste, but that is really no problem,at least there is no can disposit for this here in germany.
<h3>Overall</h3>
A great energy drink with no can disposit but an average price. I drank this one after the ANGEL Natural stuff and i felt much better afterwards.A small downer only is what i paid for it.
<h3>Rating: 8.5 of 10</h3>
