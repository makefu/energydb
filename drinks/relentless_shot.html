<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The Shot comes in a all-black small bottle with a big R on the front. Coca Cola uses their new old-school energy drink brand for this shot.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It smells like some sweet syrup. The first sip is somewhat sour and becomes sweet after a second. The after taste is somewhat weirdly sour. The drink itself tastes a lot like Blitz Start and it got the same consistency (thick).
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is one of those "shot" drinks. They probably thought no one will ever drink it for the taste. Well that is at least what i think. As most of the shot drinks, it is pretty expensive for what you get, both the nutritions and the overall volume. It might work for a longer night, but thats about it. Drink some real denergy drink instead of these shots because it tastes much better and kicks in more.
<h3>Rating: 5.0 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
A big Thanks goes to Phil for donating this energy drink to me and the energy drink database
