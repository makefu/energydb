<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes, just like the original in a small ockre colored bottle, just instead of the label being green, this one is blue (probably to strenghen it's lightness". Everything else is quite the same.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Ok before i drink it, i guess it will taste like miXXed up just bad. Most "light" drinks suck compared to their sugary counter parts. Ok it smells just like the original ... and pretty much tastes like the original as well. The sweetness is a tiny bit different , more like this replacement sugar stuff but this taste is actually not too strong. It is actually quite drinkable.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is not a bad drink. Even though it does not contain any real sugar the taste is quite similar to the no-light variant. I must say at the time of this review i just caught a cold and therfore my taste sense might be somewhat unreliable. I will drink this energy drink in the near future again and if i am wrong now with my review i will re-review this one. Also, this drink is acutally quite cheap to buy here. Mixxed up is pretty nice to put in your bag for a quick energy infusion (even if you have to watch for your waistline, girls).
<h3>Rating: 7.1 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks you Misa for pointing me to this drink as it was off the shelfs for quite some time and came back just now.
