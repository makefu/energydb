    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    It is a silver and dark green can with an outlined rhinoceros at the front, presumably the logo of this energy drink. The new cans have all kinds of labels and stuff on it. The older cans had no such labels on it and therefore seemed more pure to me.
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    Rhino's energy drink is really delicious. It is not so sweet and the gummy bear taste is not strong. It got medium CO2 and is very drinkable. I really like it!
    <h3>Overall</h3>
    When i started with searching for good energy drinks, this was one of the first drinks i really thought of "Wow, this actually tastes really really good!". Too bad the price above average and with 4 euro per liter pretty expensive. Still i buy this drink when it comes in the ads with a capaign price of 66 cents per can. One of my favorites still.
    <h3>Rating: 8.6 of 10</h3>
