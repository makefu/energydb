<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It is red bull for bikers. That's about it. At the front there is a Biker skull with a wrench instead of a second bone. The first bone has the polo logo on it. This drink is all product placement, pretty similar to the Jack Jones energy drink. The can is not printed but only has a plastic foil on top of the silver can which feels pretty cheap.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Smells like Energy Drink,i guess? It is a bit sweeter than the energy drink baseline, contains not that much CO2. Polos Energy drink is not that sour. It is at least as sweet as Red Bull Energy but contains 50 percent whey. When you drink it all the way to the bottom it gets really really sour for some reason. It does not really make the drink better...
<h3>Overall</h3>
The drink is not inherently bad but also not a good or even above-average energy drink. Polos Energy Drink is a 50 percent whey drink to make it no-desposit. I tried quite a lot whey drinks but no ordinary drink really convinced me to like these kind of drinks (besides a fruity whey drink like powerpoint juice). This drink is surely not a "must drink" as it is pretty expensive for its taste and ingredients, nothing special here. At least they haven't replaced the sugar...
<h3>Rating: 5.9 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks goes to Christopher who bought this drink on a shopping tour through the polo biker shop.
