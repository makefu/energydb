<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The RedBull Silver Edition comes in an all silver can with light grey text. The can looks pretty neat. Like all redbull drinks it has the blue tin opener. But that's about it.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Red Bull Silver smells like freshly opened lemon juice and i prepare for a sour taste explosion in my mouth. Ew, this stuff tastes really awful, somewhat like fake sprite from turkey combined with citrus dish deregent. It really tastes nothing like ordinary energy drink but i really wish it would... 
<h3>Overall</h3>
In my oppinion, the cool look of the can really contradicts with the content. The taste is horrible, especially if one might think that RedBull would only sell stuff they actually tested before. But being a "special edition" drink it probably is an experiment, which at least for me, failed big time. The drink is wicked overpriced aswell.
<h3>Rating: 3.6 of 10</h3>
