<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Take Off comes in a see-through PET bottle with a silver etiquette. At the front there is a &quot;Engine Start&quot; Button along with the logo. Besides that, nothing new nor interesting.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It definitly smells like almost every other ordinary energy drink... and pretty much tastes like these... It got really few CO2 but probably because i waited quite long until i tried this drink. If you buy it fresh, it is probably better. The drink itself is pretty sweet at the beginning, then gets quite sour. It surely is nothing special.
<h3>Overall</h3>
You can buy this drink at almost every kiosk at train stations, bus stops and cheap johnny's. The drink is not great but also does not suck too much. It is pretty generic but most of the time overpriced at the shops.
<h3>Rating: 4.5 of 10</h3>
