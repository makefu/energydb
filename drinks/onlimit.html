<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink comes in a pretty cool looking silver/black can with the beasty typing 'onLimit' text in the front. It actually looks pretty neat i must say.
<h3>Taste</h3>
onLimit smells like your ordinary energy drink. Oh my god, i think this drink wants to kill me with it's taste... At first you do not think anything bad but then the taste hits your taste buds so hard you think your mouth is going to explode... My friend tried to scrape off its tongue after drinking it. The sour/weird taste impacts far behind in your mouth. The taste is somewhat plastic and alcoholic... seriously, what the fuck?
<h3>Overall</h3>
I must say this drink really put me onLimit. This drink really really hurts bad. And i mean BAD. This weird chewing gum after taste is just so ... wrong... WProducers, have you ever tasted this drink??
<h3>Rating: 2.3 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thank you to Carolin who bought this drink on her vacations.
