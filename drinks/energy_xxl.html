<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a black and orange can with a silver stripe. On this line there is the text "get the power", well i really hope i get the power from this drink. The can is slightly bigger than normal cans (330ml instead of 250ml).
<h3>Taste</h3>
Energy XXL really smells like an ordinary energy drink. It really tastes like some ordinary drink, besides it is really really sour. It got the this gummy bear taste and the arbitrary sweetness. After a few sips the sour taste is not that bad anymore.
<h3>Overall</h3>
I must say Energy XXL is not too bad of a drink. It is too sour for my taste but besides that flavor pretty solid. The can looks somewhat cool. Not a must buy but not to bad either.
<h3>Rating: 7.7 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks goes to Wooki for this drink.
