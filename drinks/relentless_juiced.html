<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Relentless Juiced comes in the same oversized can as the original Relentless, but without the resealable top. The can is all red with grapes and &quot;Stuff&quot; i cannot really identify. There is a small quote at the back of the can, you can read all the slogans at the wikipedia page to Relentless_(drink).
<h3>Taste</h3>
This time it is an Relentless Origin offspring with berry flavour. This one smells really strong like berry syrup, hopefully it is not too sweet... Well it IS too sweet, the taste reminds me of overly sweet strawberry juice. I must say this is quite a novelty, i never drank a strawberry style energy drink. And it does not even suck bad. Relentless Juiced is a bit more sour than what you would expect of juice, this probably comes from the black currant flavor mixed inside. This definitly is one of the better juice drinks.
<h3>Overall</h3>
In my oppinion, Relentless is a nice brand created by Coca Cola where i actually have the feeling they pre-tasted the drink before selling it to everyone. I do not really understand why the resealable lock is left out for this drink, probably because it does not fit well to the slogan &quot;no half measures&quot; (hint) or it does not worked out well.
<h3>Rating: 8.5 of 10</h3>
