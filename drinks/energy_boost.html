<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
A silver and white can with a red bulldog as cover.  Actually looks really cheap.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It is really really sweet and the typical gummy bear taste is very dominant. For my taste there is not enough CO2 in it. The first taste is somewhat sour but not in a good way.
<h3>Overall</h3>
IMHO this is one of the below average cheap energy drink you stumble upon in different Super Markets. No difference here as i bought it in LD Market which is kinda like the ALDI market here in Germany. It does not really hits my taste, but it is actually really cheap. I am sure this is similar stuff to other cheap supermarket energt drinks and most likely the same stuff from the same producer
