<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a silver can with red and black printing. The full text at the front is "Energy Slammers refreshing powerdrink with the 'unique energy taste'. Well, lets see how unique it is. The can does not look too expensive (well it isn't :P ). But i must admit, it really looks like an average energy drink.
<h3>Taste</h3>
The first sip was like... mh it tastes like nothing (i thought it is because of the cold i had), but the after taste is ... "unique", really. It tastes like hubba bubba chewing gum. It is incredibly sweet and i really do not like this after taste. It does not have too much CO2 inside though, it is quite drinkable in this way.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is another energy drink from the Netherlands. It promotes its 'unique' taste and i must say the taste is somewhat unique, but not really in a good way. Most of the time breweries try out new tastes for their energy drinks they fail, this time it is not really the case. It is O.K. but surely not the best drink i ever drank. Give it a shot, you might like it. P.S. i was a bit ill the time, so i might not have described the taste 100 percent accurate.
