Only the aftertaste is somewhat apple'y but at first it really tastes like orange and a little bit mango. Well, it is more like when you never ate orange and mango, how you THINK it might taste like. Because i never  ever tried passion fruit before, i cannot tell if it got any passion fruit flavor at all.Anyway this one is not too bad, i mean, it is sweet as shit, but just a bit sweeter than most energy drinks.",
