<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink comes in a silver bottle with an orange Banner at the front. It got the Energy Fruity logo at the front, which is barely recognizable because the orange cannot be distinguished from the silver can. The can is slightly bigger than average, nearly 50 ml more inside.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Yet another drink which tastes so much like Monster Ripper. This one is so fickin' sweet my mouth nearly exploded. The after taste is just more sweet, which is NOT a good thing.. It really seems like most of these &quot;fruity&quot; drinks taste nearly the same, just more or less sweet. The smell is something between maracuya and pineapple. I mean it really would be great if it would not be so damn sweet. CURSE YOU ENERGY DRINK FACTORIES, why do you disappoint me so often???
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is another of the drinks from the M Classic series out of swizerland. I actually like these jucy drinks, but most of the drinks fail at not putting too much sweetener inside. And so is this drink, sadly. Actually it has all kinds of fruit juices inside (like apple,pear,mango), but it really tastes nothing like any of these fruits.
<h3>Rating: 7.0 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks goes to Thorsten Schoog for all the drink i am currently reviewing.
