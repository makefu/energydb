<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink comes in a all-silver can with the red e-zero logo at the front. The can looks kinda cheap but not nearly as cheap as the last drink i had from swizerland (M Budget). In fact, the can looks pretty cool and minimalistic.
<h3>Taste</h3>
OK, lets give it shot. Based on the label i prepare myself for another shitty zero-sugar drink. The smell is like an ordinary energy drink. Wow the first sip was not nearly as bad as i expected a low-cal energy drink. In fact i kinda like the taste. It is a bit sweeter than the "average" energy drink and the taste is something between gummy bears and chewing gum. The after taste is a bit bitter but it does not necessarily suck like most of these drinks.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is one of the drinks from swizerland, again sugar-free and from a super market chain (Denner). Still this drinks sucks less than the one from M Budget. Again it not really helps the drink has no sugar (taste-wise) but it is not too bad either. It is actually produced in the Netherlands, where a lot of energy drinks come from. Seems the people there have it with stuff to stimulate body and mind. It surely is not the greatest energy drink i ever had, but i am pretty optimistic it helps me over my after lunch grogginess.
