<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Rockstar Recovery comes in a Yellow and black can with a red can opener. Of course it has the same style as all the other Rockstar drinks wit the big star at the front of the can and a red plus sign to advertise their 'high' amounts of caffeine and electrolytes.
The fluid itself does not look similar to piss(like most of the energy drinks) but more like a milky fluid. It is probably because of all the electrolytes in this drink. It can best be compared to a vitamin pill put into water and waited long enough to be non-carbonated. This is actually stated at the front of the can. It is like nobody likes CO2 anyway and this drink is better because it does not contain any of it.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It smells like lemonade... nothing special here. Well the taste is like these iso drinks you can buy or like fanta without CO2. When you put it in your mouth it tastes pretty bad and when you swallow it down you think... well that was not too bad. BUT IT WAS. At least it is cold... This stuff ist just really really sweet. The after taste sucks big time and it stays in your mouth for another minute or two. When put into a glass you really can smell the electrolytes and it tastes even worse when drinking out of that glass. When you wait too long you cannot really drink any further, it is just too bad tasting. Rockstar Recovery is really nasty stuff you do not want to drink more than once. Even after drinking the whole bottle i have a sugary film on my lips and in my mouth.
<h3>Overall</h3>
It is Rockstar Lemonade WITHOUT CO2? Wtf seriously, what were they thinking? I think that this drink could be one of the better Rockstar drinks if it was not non-carbonated. The can looks pretty neat and that was because i bought it in first place, of course i haven't paid attention to the &quot;non-carbonated&quot; label at the bottom of the can. Rockstar Recovery is a trap, you buy it because it looks nice and you will not pay attention to the important parts (small imprint: NO FRICKIn' CO2 INSIDE). It gets worse and worse the longer i have waited. Well, at least this drink does not have the stated &quot;ginseng&quot; taste...
