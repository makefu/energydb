<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a green can with dark green stripes and a hemp-leaf as logo. The name 'ICE-X' is at the front with red font. As slogan the can has &quot;I FEEL GOOD!&quot; which i will come to in the Overall review. Besides that, the can obviously tries to sell it's &quot;special&quot; ingredient Hemp-flower (a.k.a. Cannabis).
<h3>Taste</h3>
It somewhat tastes like Club Mate (not yet reviewed in this Database), actually it is kinda nice. The drink is not really sweet but a somewhat tart. The aftertaste is... well weird ...? I do not really know how to describe the taste, it was when rough when swallowing it down and left a weird &quot;hemp-like&quot; taste in the throat. I really have problems to describe this one. I mean it is not bad and all,actually surprisingly good but there is somewhat, which is just different i guess.
<h3>Overall</h3>
I really thought a lot about whether i should include this drink in my energydb because it has no added caffein inside (besides the black tea extract which might contain a tiny small bit of caffein) and eventually i chose to just add it because... well better one more than one less drink. This time the special ingredient is cannabis extract which sells(mostly illegally) for it's stimulating and also relaxing effect on the human body. This drink is surely something special, tastes a lot like mate tea (see for example leet mate) and has a good amount of CO2 inside, which i really approve. This can contains the absolute maximum amount of THC, which is a good thing i guess? When drinking this drink and playing some games afterwards i cannot really tell if everyhing was funnier, but i think it was a little bit, yes. So i guess, the slogan does match at some point, even though the effect was not enormous. For that you surely must drink more than one can ;P. So if you ever see this drink somewhere and it is not too freakin' expensive, give it a shot!
<h3>Rating: 7.7 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Lots of thanks goes to Chris Gregorian who bought me this (and other drinks, which i will review in near future) for christmas. Still, why do you bought 20 MAD BAT energy drinks?????
