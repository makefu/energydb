    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    It comes in a blue can with the white NOS logo at the front. I do not know it exactly, but the can seems awfully similar to the "Monster" and "Rockstar" drinks. II once drank this drink in U.S. which came in a silver plastic bottle which actually looks like a NOS bottle, i will provide a picture of it.
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    Ihe taste is similar to the Monster Ripper drink only not that disgusting. The taste is something between artificial pineapple and artifical grapefruit. It does not have the disgusting after taste like monster ripper. It surely does not taste like every ordinary energy drink. It really is not too bad.
    <h3>overall</h3>
    Because it is so similar to the monster ripper drink (besides tasting like shit) i would guess it comes from the same factory. It is not my favorite drink, but is not too bad. Because it does not have this typical gummy taste it surely is a good alternative energy provider. They added a huge amount of caffeine inside the drink, which makes it even greater.
    <h3>rating: 7.7 of 10</h3>
    <h3>Tribute:</h3>
    A huge thanks goes to Moritz Bauer who brought this drink to Germany and sponsored me this can.
