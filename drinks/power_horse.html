<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can itself is silver with red and black imprint. The logo is a black horse(surprise!) standing on it's two rear hooves. The form factor is quite unusual for energy drinks and looks more like a beer can than an energy drink one. Even though the can looks pretty small it also contains 250ml, like most energy drinks.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Power Horse smells like chewing gum and tastes like sour gummy bears. I really cannot tell a difference between this drink and pretty much every other 'normal' energy drink. Anyway this is not necessary a bad thing. It is nothing special though.
<h3>Overall</h3>
After doing some research (aka. googling power horse and taking the the third hit to wikipedia), i found out that the S. Spitz Company pioneered energy drinks in europe with Power Horse. This means i drink a tiny bit of Energy Drink history, which suddenly make the drink more delicious. The taste is ok, pretty similar to most drinks, but nothing special. A Power Horse reseller is even claiming the URL "www.energydrinks.de"
