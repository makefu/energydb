<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can is really basic, a red and silver can with ENERGY vertically typed on the can. As this is a super market drink from denner they do not have to worry about  a fancy outside, as long the drink itself tastes ok.
<h3>Taste</h3>
OK, up for another one. It does not taste like anything out of the ordinary, expecting a pretty generic energy drink. Well what can i say, at the beginning it is really fizzly but this stops quite fast. The taste is what you expect and like from an energy drink, gummy bear taste, pretty sweet, not too sour. This one is quite drinkable i must say. Of course, like for all other energy drinks it has to be chilled in order to "not suck", same surely goes for this drink.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Denner is a Super Market in Swizerland, a quite big one as well. Luckily they decided not to create "something new" but a rock-solid energy drink worth buying. It is really really basic, the taste is good (e.g. it does not suck) and the packaging is basic. I would buy this drink a lot if i would live in swizerland. Great stuff, it does not happen often that super markets buy "the right" drinks for their sortiment instead of buy drinks that suck, but are dirt cheap and are getting bought because of that instead of actually tasting good. I am drinking this one at 12:45 pm here in germany and i hope for a great kick for my productivity when working on my projects this night. I am really confident in the power of this drink. I really must say the price is absolutely great for a canned energy drink. Here in Germany you will normally not find so cheap canned drinks that do not suck.
