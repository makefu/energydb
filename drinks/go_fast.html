<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink comes in a Red and Black can with the White "GO FAST!" logo. At the front all the goodness is listed (see Overall). The fluid itself has a yellowy color. The can design does not look cheap to me, but it surely is not "premium" or anywhere near the given price tag (for the Netherlands).
<h3>Taste</h3>
Man this smells like yoghurt gummy.  It is really intriguing and the light sparkling is actually pretty audible. It tastes... weird, but not necessarily bad. It somewhat tastes like yoghurt. The taste stays really long inside your mouth and it is somewhat gooey. It surely does not taste like an ordinary energy drink. Go fast leaves a sugary sweet on my tongue and my teeth. I do not know but something is wrong with the after taste but i cannot tell what. This drink gives me a slight head ache. When the drink gets warmer the taste becomes more intense, slightly sour, but definitly not better... 
<h3>Overall</h3>
"Go Fast!" is another of the famous (and infamous) dutch energy drinks. This one 'has' to be good because it contains all goodness possible. Go Fast combines honey,taurine,niacin,ginseng,guarana,riboflavin,vitamin b6 and 12 AND Ginkgo Biloba. This surely is a premium energy drink ,not only price wise as it is more expensive than red bull! But i must say the taste is not like all the powers combined, more like a berry energy drink. 
When you wait too long to drink it the CO2 fades and the taste gets worse. That is probably why the drink is called "Go Fast!" because you better drink it up fast before it starts to suck. There are quite a few energy drinks which behave that way, probably because it is a slight violation of rule number 1: "Never drink a warm energy drink".
The drink is quite different in taste from ordinary drinks but not that different from juicy and berry energy drinks. Conclusion: It is drinkable but not great deal.
<h3>Rating: 5.9 of 10</h3>
