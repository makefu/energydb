    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    The can looks really cool with its black front and its white/bronze text. At the bottom it says KEINE HALBEN SACHEN (no things done by halve) but actually is resealable. It is not really simple to drink from this, but the cap holds really tight! 
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    The taste is really smooth and not too sweet. It does not taste much like gummy bears, which is, at least for me, a good thing. I really like it. When drinking it you really feal empowered.
    <h3>Overall</h3>
    I must say this is one of my favorite energy drinks.  It tastes not incredibly sweet. Got average taurine and caffein contents and comes in a big bottle. The only downside for me is the resealable cap, which is somewhat hard to drink from and the above average price.
    <h3>Rating: 8.5 of 10</h3>
