<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink comes in a black can  with white lines and text.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Yep, it's Energy Drink. It is not that sweet, tastes somewhat like ... well energy drink? This is "the" definitive average energy drink. I mean it is not "extreme" in any way, but this is definitly a pro. I like it!
<h3>Overall</h3>
I must say i somewhat like it. It does not taste bad and everything, but it is really nothing special. One problem is the price tag which is really above average. This is one of these promotional drinks labeled by the companies. I hope to find the "original" energy drink with the data collected.
<h3>Rating: 8.1 of 10</h3>
