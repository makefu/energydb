<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Afri Cola comes in a black(surprise) can with the white logo at the front. The logo is some kind of stylized palm tree i guess. All in all the can is really minimmalistic. In addition to that there is the 25mg caffein icon. This was actually because i bought this drink, because of it's massive amount of caffeine inside this innocent looking beverage.
<h3>Taste</h3>
As this is no ordinary energy drink i do not expect something out of ordinary bad or weird taste some exotic drinks have. Aaaand ... yep, it's coke. As i said, i  haven't expected anything less. Pretty sweet when swallowing it down and it has a whole bunch of Sparking CO2 inside, which i definitly like! If i would have to guess which is which between Coca Cola and Afri Cola i most likely would fail with a 50 percent chance. I really hope for the &quot;kick&quot; in half an hour!
<h3>Overall</h3>
Yes, this is one of the drinks i am not really sure again if it fits inside the &quot;energydb&quot;, but i found it all right because of the exceptionally high amount of caffeine. Afri Cola tastes like Coke with a great amount of CO2, looks pretty neat and packs a great punch. I would always prefer this drink over original coke or pepsi. You will most likely find this drink only here in Germany or via export and in my oppinion it is really worth a try!
