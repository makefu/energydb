<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It is a red can with a bird in the front. I think it should be an eagle or something in front of three pyramids but it looks more like an angry seagul to me (which is even worse!). It says Energy Drink Maca Power, stating that they included something extraordinary into the drink.  The drink itself is pink, which was kinda surprising only knowing either ordinary energy drinks with this yellow-greenish color or the berry offsprings being pink.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Given the fact Maca is in this stuff it does not really taste any different from all the other energy drinks. It somewhat tastes more like bubble gum (like HubbaBubba) than Gummy bears and it is, like most of these drinks, very sweet. It does not taste bad or anything, but i expected more of Maca(whatever this stuff is anyway).
<h3>Overall</h3>
This stuff is actually not bad, even though i do not really like the bubble gum taste in my energy drink. Be sure to check this one out if you get the chance. I mean it contains Maca and stuff!
