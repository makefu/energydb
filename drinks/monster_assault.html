<h3>Look</h3>
Quote: 'We put the "camo" pattern on our new Monster Assault because we think it looks cool.Plus it helps fire us up to fight the big multi-national companies who dominate the beverage business.'. The drink has a grey and black camo pattern and a red M aka. the Monster Logo in front of the can. "Assault" is written in army type face.
<h3>Taste</h3>
This time it is Monster Assault, i really hope it does not want to assault my mouth with bad taste. Actually i do not really have high hopes for this one as Monster Ripper failed horribly. Ok it smells a bit like cherry ... Well i must say Monster Assault tastes like Cherry Coke for some matter. Actually the taste is not that bad, which is surprising for that matter. Most "fruity" energy drinks suck big times but this one is pretty neat. The cherry taste is a bit too sweet for my taste but not too dominant. It got this weird Ginseng after taste like all Monster Energy Drinks, but it is not too strong. I guess the coke taste comes from the phosphor acid inside.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Monster Assault is a pretty neat drink which does not really suck as bad as all the other Monster drinks i drank until today. The cherry taste is somewhat different towards all the ordinary energy drinks. It sure is special, in taste AND look. Check it out
