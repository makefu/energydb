<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The packaging looks very familiar, in fact it totally is the same design and packaging as Action Energy Drink in a can.

The instruction says "add 200ml cold water" and then it is done. The tablet dissolves kinda quickly in the water.

After the tablet is disappeared you get a greeny-brown drink without any bubbles. The drink does not really look that delicous. Actually the drink you get does look pretty similar to the canned version of Action Energy besides the fact there is no CO2 inside.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Now THAT is something different. Normally i only review drinks which are already in the fluid state when i buy them. Action Energy Drink Tabs come in small fizzy tablets. "Just add Water" and you get your delicious beverage. It does not have any smell and the first sip is ... not that great. Even though the tablet was sparkling and everying when adding water, it does not contain any CO2 at the end. These Action Tabs are very sweet and have a kinda weird after taste. I cannot really describe what it is, but it surely does not taste great, it probably comes from the fake sugar. When i bought these they might actually taste like the original Action Energy Drink and therefore i bought the can as a reference in taste. In fact, the "real" action drink tastes much much better, much due to the fact that it contains CO2 and probably because they added real sugar instead of the replacement sweetening stuff. The original drink is much more sour and less sweet than the tabs(even though it has 11g sugar in it). The after taste is also not that disgusting. 
I tried a lot in order to make the tablets taste better. The first thing i tried out was to add the tablets to a tiny bit of water and after it dissolved adding sparking water. Still, after 10 seconds all the CO2 disappeared from the beverage, which is kinda sad because i think these tables may taste better with added CO2. 
I also tried to add just a small bit of water and then add the tablet. The smell of this mixture is incredibly strong, nearly as strong as inhalating the pulver from the tablets itself. I actually have some hassle to drink it...my god...it is like pure sugar in water. My mouth is somewhat glued together and the taste won't disappear. I had to drink some of the original drink to make it go away....
Well it probably was not the best idea to all these test at the same time, i can already feel the caffeine kicking in, i feel kinda shaky.
<h3>Overall</h3>
I wanted to do this "drink" for a long time but just haven't found the time to do a full-fledged review about it. These Action Tabs are a great example for (ab)using an already existing brand for something really different. Still the tablets  are not too far away from the canned version. 

If you need a quick caffeine kick, try adding just a tiny bit of water to the tablet and swallow it down. It will be somewhat disgusting and be sure to drink lots of water after it, but it is better than adding the water to the drink i first place. This is pretty similar to the energy shots you can buy from different brands.

The Action Energy Drink fizzy tablets have great experimenting value, be sure not to overplay it. Still, i like the canned version of Action, and prettty much every other sparkling energy drink better than this stuff.
The tablets contain much of the "good stuff" and are pretty cheap, because it includes 20 tablets for 200ml each instead of just one drink. The tablets surely have some advantages over 'ready to drink' energy drinks, but do not taste that "great". 
Be sure to check them out if you have the chance, it is quite something different and has great mixing potential.

P.S.
The nutritions are calculated for one tablet in 200 ml water (similar to a 200ml energy drink). To get the ingredients for one tablet, just multiply by two.
