<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
I bought the small 500ml see through bottle (there is also a 1.5 l variant). It got a striped blue/white label with the red and blue big pump logo in the front. It says "filled with big pump original recipe". The bottle got a plastic seal which is reclosable. Well you can close it but it sure as hell is not sealed after that again (there now is energy drink all over the floor...)
<h3>Taste</h3>
This was the first energy drink i drank which actually tasted kinda good. It is not incredibly sweet, the gummy bear taste is not that dominant. It is a little bit sour and the after taste is ok.
<h3>Overall</h3>
The overall idea to start an energy drink database started with big pump, because it was the first energy drink which taste didn't sucked. I really like the taste and the price is fine too. One of my personal favorite drinks.
<h3>Rating: 9.0 of 10</h3>
