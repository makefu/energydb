    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    Somewhat cheap looking blue can with silver backdrop. In the front there is a exploding core or maybe a brain cell or i don't know.
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    Tastes actually really good. Typical Energy Drink taste, not too much CO2, really sweet.
    <h3>Overall</h3>
    Tastes like an ordinary energy drink. Nothing special but rock solid. It also was not really expensive. Produced for Carrefour which is orginally located in France but i found that one in italy,milano
    <h3>Rating: 8 of 10</h3>
