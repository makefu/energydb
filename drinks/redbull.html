<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Blue and silver Can with two bulls in the middle fighting against eachother. Most people know it.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It got that energy-type gummy bear taste, is pretty sweet and comes with quite a lot of CO2. For me it really is too sweet and the gummy taste is too intense. The after-taste is somewhat sour.It tastes ok but it surely is not GREAT.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This drink can be concidered THE energydrink period.  You can buy it everywhere, its in the commercials. Anyway this does not mean it tastes incredibly awesome or packs a real punch, but the Public Relation Department did a great job pushing this drink.  For me it surely does not taste like the `best` drink and i think it is really overpriced but you can buy it nearly everywhere. I got mine really cheap from Kaufland as a special offer, otherwise i would not have bought it.It surely defines for most people what a energy drink is, anyway not for me as i can tell from its taste and from drinking quite a few energy drinks in my life. On my quest for drinking all the energy drinks in the world i will try to find which drinks are the same but have a different packaging.Reference will be this drink because i am really sure they sell their stuff under different names.
