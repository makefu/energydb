<h3>Look</h3>
Quote: 'We put the &quot;camo&quot; pattern on our new Monster Assault because we think it looks cool.Plus it helps fire us up to fight the big multi-national companies who dominate the beverage business.'. The drink has a grey and black camo pattern and a red M aka. the Monster Logo in front of the can. &quot;Assault&quot; is written in army type face.
<h3>Taste</h3>
This time it is Monster Assault, i really hope it does not want to assault my mouth with bad taste. Actually i do not really have high hopes for this one as Monster Ripper failed horribly. Ok it smells a bit like cherry ... Well i must say Monster Assault tastes like Cherry Coke for some matter. Actually the taste is not that bad, which is surprising for that matter. Most &quot;fruity&quot; energy drinks suck big times but this one is pretty neat. The cherry taste is a bit too sweet for my taste but not too dominant. It got this weird Ginseng after taste like all Monster Energy Drinks, but it is not too strong. I guess the coke taste comes from the phosphor acid inside.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Monster Assault is a pretty neat drink which does not really suck as bad as all the other Monster drinks i drank until today. The cherry taste is somewhat different towards all the ordinary energy drinks. It sure is special, in taste AND look. Check it out
