<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Recharge energy comes in a Green to Yellow to Red can with the Green Sands Logo. I must say the drink does not look too bad and promises a "refreshing" energy drink.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Recharge smells like all these red gummy bears. Lets give it a shot... HOLY SHI- IT IS SO SWEET AND STICKY... I cannot really describe this taste but it is definitly NOT GOOD... It really glues your mouth. My face when drinking looks like this D:
<h3>Overall</h3>
No none would have guessed this drink sucks so bad. I already heard from two people that Green Sands is not best brand for "good" drinks. I mean it does not taste like the worst drink (a big pro is that it is not still) but it is just incredibly so so sweet and sticky.
<h3>Rating: 4.0 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thank you Misa for buying this drink for me from indonesia
