<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can looks pretty neat, black red and silver, with a black stylized dragon on it. Plus the name rocks pretty hard, could be a heavy metal band.
<h3>Taste</h3>
O.K. Megaforce, do not fail me, i have high hopes based on your name! Mhhh, nothing special with the smell but i still hope for the best. BAH!!! Fuck, why you fail me so hard? Nearly no CO2 inside, really really sour and has some kind of plastic taste. This me-too product fails for me at least.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This drink could be good if the taste wouldn't suck so bad, well at least it already has the right name. Megaforce is also a 1982 film, which supposendly sucks pretty bad. So the drink and the film has at least that in common. At least the price was good, even though i got it as special offer.
<h3>Rating: 4.0 of 10</h3>
