INTRODUCTION
============
Every man has a goal in life, mine is to drink every energy drink in the
world! 

In this process i want to review, categorize and describe every one of
them. The idea is to create a database of all energydrink i ever drunk,
completely with ingredients like caffeine or sugar.

For that i will design a database scheme which can handle my demands, as
well as a web frontend which is able to search through and view the entries
very similar to a cms. Currently there is only a static site generator with
some templates, more will come.

Keep in Mind
------------
... that this project is an VERY early stage and i am currently mostly
interested in creating data entries of drinks i drank. Occasionally i will
implement of what i think are "cool" features like a changelog or RSS feed
but do not expect a great deal of changes in a very short timespan. 

It would be really really glad if anyone could provide useful informations 
how to make the design for the front page and the single drink pages, 
because i am somewhat retarded in that way.

Even better would be a pull request with fixed css and/or mustache template
files. 

Installation and Usage
=====
you will need the following things to add new drinks automagically and
generate the database.

- python 2.6
- simplejson (pip install simplejson)
- pystashe (Mustache for python), currently a fork which fixes inner
  contexts from http://github.com/rafaelcv/pystache
- markdown (pip install markdown) for genrating html from this README

Help me!
========
I would be more than glad if something of this project helped you, you may
send me one of the energy drinks i have never drank before ( check db).
Send me a quick mail and we might meet up somewhere here in germany.
