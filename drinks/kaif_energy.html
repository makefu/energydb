<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink i got as merchandise from IT-Seal and the design is quite nice - at least their logo looks fun.
The can has some plastic foil on top to apply the custom design, however i like printed cans better.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Well, here we go again. The drink tastes like your generic energy drink. To be honest i would never be able to taste the difference between this drink and any other generic drink.
Even though it is generic it could be much worse!
<h3>Overall</h3>
As merchandise this drink is totally fine, however i would not pay full price for it in the supermarket. It got a couple of additives (E330,E331,E150c) but the more the merrier, right?
Just steal it from the vendors on the exhibition if you have the chance, you can even cash in the can deposit at the end!
<h3>Rating: 6.5 of 10</h3>
