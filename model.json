The taste while drinking is actually pretty good, not too sweet. The after taste is really sweet, like most drinks. I kinda like it.",

There is definitly not too much prickling on my tongue. It does not have the typical gummy bear taste like most energy drinks, this is probably because it does not contain any taurine.",
