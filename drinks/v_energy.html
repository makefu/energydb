<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a green can with the black &quot;V&quot; logo at the front. The V looks like the atom symbol. It looks kinda cool though.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Tastes really... weird. It got a somewhat 'smokey', bitter after taste. I cannot really say i like it. There is not much CO2 in the drink, which, for me is definitly a minus. There is definitly not too much prickling on my tongue. It does not have the typical gummy bear taste like most energy drinks, this is probably because it does not contain any taurine.
<h3>Overall</h3>
It was nice to have a really different taste from ordinary drink, but &quot;special&quot; does not always mean &quot;better&quot;. Therefore i cannot really recommend it. The after taste is just weird.
<h3>Rating: 5.8 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Very special Thanks goes to Melissa for buying this drink for me in the Netherlands
