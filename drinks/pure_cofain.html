<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can does not look that exciting. The drink comes in a all black can with the "Pure Cofain" logo at the front. Under that the number 699 (mg per 1000ml caffeine) is printed on. Under that number there is a warning label that this drink contains "GRACIOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY". At the back there is another warning label that this drink can create all kinds of side effects, pretty similar to real pharmaceuticals.
<h3>Taste</h3>
I must say it smells like coffee, pretty neat i must say. Oh my god, this is so bitter. Totally like cold coffee with CO2. This can contains some weird shit. The first sip is really really weird but after that you get used to it and is a really unique drink. This one surely does not have the typical energy drink taste. If you want the coffee taste one might really want to drink this one. The after taste is like coffee and coke mixed together. Be sure to check this one out if you get the chance.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is pure cofain, the first energy drink i found here which has coffain contents far above the given limit of 32mg per 100ml here in Germany. The drink itself contains a massive 69.9mg caffeine per 100ml, no other added vitamins or taurine though. It has a warning banner similar to cigarrettes. It is produced in Austria and the warning banner at the back recommends one can per day as a maximum value. The can is pretty expensive, but hell, the taste is really unique and i think it would even make a good attached gift for a friend. If you ever get the chance, try it for yourself.
