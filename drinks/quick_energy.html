<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Quick energy comes in a small plastic bottle with an orange plastic label wrapped all over it. If you want to drink it you have to peel off the complete label (or at least i had to) in order to open the bottle. The cap is resealable which does not really make sense for me to reseal an energy shot... The fluid itself is translucent. I must say the packaging looks rather nice but it has to in order to lure you into buying this stuff once. 
<h3>Taste</h3>
There are not many energy shots which actually taste really good but i have high hopes in this one because the flavour is &quot;orange&quot;. After opening the drink smells like a decomposed Vitamin pill. Oh my god it tastes to bad..... i cannot really describe it... quick is  like slime crawling down your throat killing everything it the way. It feels somewhat like i am drinking a glass chemicals from a toilet cleaner factory.  I feel like i need to puke... I cannot really drink any further. Ok whatever, Oh god this is so bad, i feel kinda raped now. And the taste does not go away, it stays in your mouth and there is nothing you can do about it. This was probably the worst energy shot i ever drank.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Good thing is it comes only in such a small bottle but because the bottle neck is so thin you have to take multiple gulps to finish it. After this drink the head ache kicked in immediately. As they state on the bottle there is no crash, but a downer from the beginning. Holy crap, again i am asking me if they actually tasted their drink before selling it. But i guess not. Quick energy is from the USA ... and i thought they know how to do energy drinks. Well, at least it contains massive amounts of caffeine (175mg per bottle) but still this not worth it.
The bottle is sold as nutritional supplement but i cannot think of one time where i would need THAT DRINK as supplement. I would rather eat a lemon as a whole than drinking this stuff.
