<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Silver can with Blue BOOSTER at the front. Looks pretty cheap to me.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It actually does not have a strong gummy bear taste, more like something else.. chemical. I do not really know what it is but it definitly tastes different. Of curse again it is very sweet and all but it is different. It is a really weird feelin when i gulp it and my head starts to feel weird. A sour aftertaste enhances this feling.
<h3>Overall</h3>
It is incredibly cheap so at least give it a try. The taste is weird and i o not really like it much, it just feels wrong. Maybe it is just today where i triedit.. Maybe it is just me.
<h3>Rating: 6.2 of 10</h3>
