    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    It is a black can with a drawn tiger on the front (most likely a well known tattoo by ed hardy). For me it looks somewhat stupid. I do not like the style of these tattoos at all.
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    It tastes a lot like some very sweet berry juice.  The taste is very intense, it actually is too sweet in my opinion.  It got a below average CO2 contents or maybe it is because it fell down when i bought it.
    <h3>Overall</h3>
    It is not my taste and i do not really like the style.  The price is above average, but it surely packs a punch with all the added stuff in it. My guess is you pay a lot for the name, not the good taste.
    <h3>Rating: 4 of 10</h3>
