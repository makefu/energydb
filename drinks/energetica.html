<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Energetica comes in a silver can with an orange spiral with the Energetica Logo at the middle. For having orange stripes i would have guessed this drinks is more... citrus tasting but it seems that is not really true. Purple stripes probably would have fit better.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Energetica smells horribly strong like gummy bear taste, probably berry taste...Oh my god energetica??? Why do you hurt so much? It is so so so sweet at the beginning and becomes so damn sour my mouth nearly imploded. I guess the taste is something between red berry and grape, probably? I cannot really tell as this drink is so so so sour....
<h3>Overall</h3>
This energy drink totally blew my mouth. I never would have expected this innocent looking drink is so frickin' sour (nearly as sour as She Energy...). If you totally want to kill your taste buds, try this drink. Energetica is a drink you will probably only find in spain as it smees pretty local and native to buy.
<h3>Rating: 5.5 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks goes to Carolin who bought this drink on her vacations in Valencia,Spain.
