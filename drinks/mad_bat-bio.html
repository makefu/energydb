<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
As the original Mad Bat, it comes in a paper package can. But this time the can is green, because it is BIO (organic). There are all kinds of bio ingredients in this drink. Plus it got all kinds of stickers on which tell the stuff is super healthy and everything is good for you inside this drink. Still, this is the MAD BAT, by definition this drink cannot be that great, right?
<h3>Taste</h3>
Ok, this will be one of my greatest challenges... Mad Bat BIO Energy, the revenge of Mad Bat. Well, it smells like apple, not nearly as bad as mad bat. Ok... the first sip is not too bad i must say. Mad Bad BIO tastes like apple concentrate. Just pretty sweet apple juice. There is no real typical energy drink taste, not even the typical mad bat taste. I cannot really hate this drink, even though it IS  mad bat and is still. If i would not know it better it would say it is cheap discounter apple juice.
<h3>Overall</h3>
What can i say, the revenge of Mad Bat was quite disappointing. I thought this drink sucks even more than the original one and that my current measure scale is not enough to describe this drink... but this drink is far too good to be in the league of the original mad bat... It is pretty mediocre, and if you do not like energy drinks, this one might even be for you. It is apple juice, with energy! After a closer look at the ingredients i found out there is nearly none of the good stuff in it (just one third of the &quot;normal&quot; caffeine inside, no taurine, no other vitamins...)
