<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can looks so cheap, i cannot really describe it. It is dark red with the cheaply drawn panther in front of some color gradient from red to white. The "Black Cat Energy Drink" text is in some bold black font and the "Juicy" is just cheaply edited in there in a totally different yellow font. I am totally overwhelmed of how bad a design can be.WoW...
<h3>Taste</h3>
Black Cat juicy smells like a apple and berry mix and surprise, that is what the packaging says "Pomegranate and Cranberry". The first sip is, well, not that great i must say. It is incredibly sweet, the after taste is pretty sour. Surely this drink does not have the typical gummy taste but its own taste is not that great either. If you would be guessing the taste one might actually tasted something apple-ish behind all the sugar. 
<h3>Overall</h3>
It seems like this drink is somewhat special, like a limited time offer from the Supermarked i purchased it. It was there for like a month and now totally disappered. It is great if producers try something new and pull back if they see their stuff didn't sell out (aka they fucked it up). Still, i cannot recommend this drink.
<h3>Rating: 5.0 of 10</h3>
