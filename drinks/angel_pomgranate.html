    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    It comes in a white plastic bag, with a red ANGEL on at the front. Like most of the non-CO2 energy drinks, the packaging is somewhat similar to the capri sun packagings.
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    Oh my god this is so sweet.It tastes incredibly disgusting like drinking pure syrup.
    <h3>Overall</h3>
    Even though i never drank a CO2 free energy drink which tasted good i though i would give this one a shot.Bad idea, now i got some serious head ache.I give 1 point for the packaging, which is kinda cool and the average caffein content
