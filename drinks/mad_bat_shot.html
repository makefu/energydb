<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Mad bat shot comes in a silver and metallic red 60ml shot bottle with a red cap. In the front there is the mad bat logo so you can prepare yourself for what is to come. You probably even find a way to reuse the bottle for other fluids or spices or something, that is pretty neat.The drink itself kinda looks like pee or apple juice. I would compare it to the first one. 
<h3>Taste</h3>
Let's get on with it. I dare you, I double dare you mad bat, do not kill my taste buds again! Well, it does not smell too promising somewhat like plastic turned into an energy drink... It is a shot so i better drink it up in one rush. Mh i am kinda scared by that one. Oh my god... wtf... who would really want to drink that??? My eyes, i cannot see shit.. WHYYYY???? I remember the taste of mad bat, everything comes back. All the bad memories... Mad bat shot has a very similar taste besides it does not taste THAT much like plastic. It is also incredibly mind crubling sweet. Even worse is the drink is not really fluid but kinda like syrup or honey you are trying to swallow down. Holy shit man, i hope i do not have to drink this stuff ever again.
<h3>Overall</h3>
OK, according to my experiences with the original mad bat energy drink, this one cannot be much worse.... or can it? I mean this is an energy shot and that is something i normally do not like too much. At least it is finished quickly because of the small size. Oh man, after drinking this i do not really feel energized, more like all my power rushed out of me, i got head ache from the taste. This sure as hell cannot be good for you. You can probably compare it with other energy drinks from china, the ones without CO2 but the consistency really killed me. Again, have they ever even tested what they have brewed together? Seriously mad bat team... A pro is, that it got all the ingredients for a balanced breakfast, even though it is not overly much inside. I was hoping for a pretty decent mat bat drink like the mad bat bio energy drink but i kinda expected it to as bad as the original. It is not THE worst drink but it is really really bad.
