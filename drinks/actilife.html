<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can has a yellow and red look on a white background with a womans shilouette in green. The can looks quite stylish and is vaguely reminiscient of some coke commercials. The logo is a little running white stickfigure. The can also bears the slogan &quot;Be You&quot; which is just silly.
<h3>Taste</h3>
WTF...How can anyone like this? Again a drink for women and again it is freakin disgusting... This one is incredibly sour and in the aftertaste that replacement sugar taste rapes your mouth. After swallowing it gets really bitter... but why??? Do the producer think that women believe if it tastes disgusting it must be healthy? There is no other chance they still produce and sell this stuff.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Looks good, smells bad, tastes worse. The marketing strategy seems to be to hide the disgusting contents in a pretty container. Why can they not put a normal energy drink into this can. It could still be for women, but not taste so shitty. Of course the artificial sweetener is noticeable, as it makes all energy drinks worse.
<h3>Rating: 2.1 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks goes to Thorsten Schoog, but this energy drink still sucks.
