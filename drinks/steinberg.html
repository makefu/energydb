<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Black can with some musician or something on it, very graphical
<h3>Taste</h3>
I really really like this stuff with whey. It tastes not too soure, average CO2, not too sweet gummy bear taste. I like it
<h3>Overall</h3>
I got this one from the IFA Berlin at the UNIMALL promotion booth, for that i had a small chatter what they do and stuff.In the end i got this delicios energy drink.This is the kind of energy drink i really like to drink. Tastes almost the same as the Russian Power stuff, at least check this stuff out or send unimall.de a mail you want one of these drinks. It was free for me, that definitly is a plus.
<h3>Rating: 9.1 of 10</h3>
