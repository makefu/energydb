<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a blue and red can with a red and white star in the middle. It somewhat looks like what i think russian beer should look like. I drank the &quot;big can&quot; version with 440 ml, not that big after all.
<h3>Taste</h3>
When opened it smells like every other energy drink. Well, it actually tastes like most energy drinks, with more chewing gum and less gummy bear taste. The taste while drinking is actually pretty good, not too sweet. The after taste is really sweet, like most drinks. I kinda like it.
<h3>Overall</h3>
As &quot;The Star of Energy&quot; its pretty mediocre. I mean it tastes O.K. but it is definitly not the greatest drink i ever drank in my life. As this is the first swiss energy drink i drank (8 more to come) i have high hopes for the remaining ones.
<h3>Rating: 7.1 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks to Thorsten Schoog for this drink. You are awesome!
