<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
XL Cranberry comes in a red and black can, with the XL logo at the front. I like bigger cans better than the standard ones but most of the time you do not have a choice. Besides that there is nothing special with this can. 
<h3>Taste</h3>
XL Cranberry smells pretty fruity, and yes, it also tastes fruity as well. One letdown is that this drink is incredibly sweet, almost too sweet for me. The after taste is something between chewing gum and cranberries marinated in sugar.XL Cranberry does not have the typical energy drink taste, more like a fruit juice. It is actually a pretty good fruit energy drink.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is the first one of the "XL" Series, they call it "Cranberry" taste... well, yes it actually does taste like cranberry. There are few energy drinks which do taste fruity and do not suck. This one is presumably one of them. But again, its all a matter of taste. There are 4 more "XL" drinks to go, let's see how these drinks perform. 
<h3>Rating: 7.9 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Special Thanks goes to Melissa for buying these drink in Hamburg.
