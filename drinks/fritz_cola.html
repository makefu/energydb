<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It is a pretty simple bottle with a black sticker with two heads on it. I kinda like the look, it makes the Coke _cool_.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It tastes like normal coke with a tiny bit of citrus. It is really refreshening and is really similar to stuff like Vita Cola. In addition it got LOTS of caffein in it.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Even though at first i did not thought it is a real ENERGY DRINK but when i looked at the caffein contents my mind changed. The taste is really nice and smooth and got 25mg of the good stuff. For me it is a real go-go, check it out. I mean it.
<h3>Rating: 8.4 of 10</h3>
