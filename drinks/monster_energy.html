<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
black can, green M. One of the more common energy drinks
<h3>Taste</h3>
Its somewhat tastes like soap and flowers when warm.Besides that the drink really sweet (haven't drunk it chilled though).There is  not enough CO2 in it, which makes the drink not sour at all. When cold it tastes much better, more like lychie and not as sweet. Not the typical gummy bear taste... UPDATE: Today(17.12.2010) i tried the drink again and i must say, it still sucks. It still got this soapy after taste and is far too sweet.
<h3>Overall</h3>
drank this before in the US. enough for a long night.  Must drink chilled, otherwise it will taste really bad. UPDATE: I must say it does not taste too got even when it is cold.. After this Re-Review i must cut down the score by 0.8 (why you might ask 0.8? well i dunno really, i guess a bit arbitrariness cannot be wrong).
<h3>Rating: 6.7 of 10</h3>
