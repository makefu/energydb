<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It is an all white can with green an silver pattern.This actually looks pretty cool. It looks kinda expensive to me.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It tasts somewhat like citrus juice with lots of sugar.  Actually this is really good and tasts well. For me it killed my thirst ( which is something special with energy drinks). Does not have this gummy bear taste or at least not really intense.
<h3>Overall</h3>
This stuff is really great for the taste. Even though it does not have taurine in it, it gives you enough energy to move on on a lazy saturday. And for the price you at least have to try it once!
<h3>Rating: 8 of 10</h3>
