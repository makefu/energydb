Still the tablets  are not too far away from the canned version. \n\nIf you need a quick caffeine kick, try adding just a tiny bit of water to the tablet and swallow it down. It will be somewhat disgusting and be sure to drink lots of water after it, but it is better than adding the water to the drink i first place. This is pretty similar to the energy shots you can buy from different brands.\n\nThe Action Energy Drink fizzy tablets have great experimenting value, be sure not to overplay it. Still, i like the canned version of Action, and prettty much every other sparkling energy drink better than this stuff.\nThe tablets contain much of the \"good stuff\" and are pretty cheap, because it includes 20 tablets for 200ml each instead of just one drink. The tablets surely have some advantages over 'ready to drink' energy drinks, but do not taste that \"great\". \nBe sure to check them out if you have the chance, it is quite something different and has great mixing potential.\n\nP.S.\nThe nutritions are calculated for one tablet in 200 ml water (similar to a 200ml energy drink).

Action Energy Drink Tabs come in small fizzy tablets. \"Just add Water\" and you get your delicious beverage. It does not have any smell and the first sip is ... not that great. Even though the tablet was sparkling and everying when adding water, it does not contain any CO2 at the end. These Action Tabs are very sweet and have a kinda weird after taste. I cannot really describe what it is, but it surely does not taste great, it probably comes from the fake sugar. When i bought these they might actually taste like the original Action Energy Drink and therefore i bought the can as a reference in taste. In fact, the \"real\" action drink tastes much much better, much due to the fact that it contains CO2 and probably because they added real sugar instead of the replacement sweetening stuff. The original drink is much more sour and less sweet than the tabs(even though it has 11g sugar in it). The after taste is also not that disgusting. \nI tried a lot in order to make the tablets taste better. The first thing i tried out was to add the tablets to a tiny bit of water and after it dissolved adding sparking water. Still, after 10 seconds all the CO2 disappeared from the beverage, which is kinda sad because i think these tables may taste better with added CO2. \nI also tried to add just a small bit of water and then add the tablet. The smell of this mixture is incredibly strong, nearly as strong as inhalating the pulver from the tablets itself. I actually have some hassle to drink it...my god...it is like pure sugar in water. My mouth is somewhat glued together and the taste won't disappear. I had to drink some of the original drink to make it go away....\nWell it probably was not the best idea to all these test at the same time, i can already feel the caffeine kicking in, i feel kinda shaky.",

Great stuff, it does not happen often that super markets buy \"the right\" drinks for their sortiment instead of buy drinks that suck, but are dirt cheap and are getting bought because of that instead of actually tasting good. I am drinking this one at 12:45 pm here in germany and i hope for a great kick for my productivity when working on my projects this night. I am really confident in the power of this drink. I really must say the price is absolutely great for a canned energy drink. Here in Germany you will normally not find so cheap canned drinks that do not suck.",

Energy Rocket is one of the 'cheapo' energy drinks you can buy at big market centers. The drink does not taste great, like most cheap drinks, but you at least have the chance to get your caffeine kick. The bottle looks cheap, the etiquette label too, but one will most likely not buy this drink because it is something special. ",

The taste is, as expected, not good but average in terms of energy drinks. Energy Rocket has this plastic after taste combined with a very sugary taste. You can drink it very fast because this drink does not have an awful lot of CO2 inside. This drink might work as a mix-in but not pure, at least not for me. I changed the rating from 8 to 6 after retrying this drink. It seems my scale has changed after drink energy drinks like the 'schwarze dose' or 'relentless energy'.",

You can probably compare it with other energy drinks from china, the ones without CO2 but the consistency really killed me. Again, have they ever even tested what they have brewed together? Seriously mad bat team... A pro is, that it got all the ingredients for a balanced breakfast, even though it is not overly much inside.

Oh my god... wtf... who would really want to drink that??? My eyes, i cannot see shit.. WHYYYY???? I remember the taste of mad bat, everything comes back. All the bad memories... Mad bat shot has a very similar taste besides it does not taste THAT much like plastic. It is also incredibly mind crubling sweet.

The can is pretty small (but normal size for energy drinks) and it might not contain enough caffeine for a very very long night (see 500ml cans like Relentless) if you are already used to consume large amounts of caffeine.\nFor an energy drink this one was not too expensive for buying it at a 24/7 shop.

After drinking it i do not really know if they really earned their award but the drink surely does not suck bad. It feels like they tasted their own beverage before selling it (in contrast to Mad Bat). The can looks rather nice though. I bought it pretty expensive but if it would be cheaper (and available in my surrounding area) i would buy it again.",

It is not as sour as most of the drinks and atop of that Wild Dragon does not taste like shit or weird or anything. It is still really sweet. When you wait too long the taste becomes rather sour again and it looses most of the CO2. Wild Dragon is not the best energy drink in terms of taste but it is above average.",
