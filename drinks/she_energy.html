<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a pink can with a she-superman logo (or diamond) with a devils tail. As this is an netherland energy drink, everything text on the can is dutch language, which is a pain in the ass to decypher.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It somewhat smells like synthetic peach at the first smell. When you drink it, the first sip is like... mhh this really smells like peach or something. Then you swallow it down, it tastes like apple or something, THEN it is like a punch in the face by SOUR. If you ever tried Center Shock chewing gum, this is the opposite of them, first somewhat delicious and then incredibly sour(painful). I never thought this is ever possible with an energy drink. Everything inside your mouth feels tingly, probably not made by human.
<h3>Overall</h3>
I do not know if this really is a womens drink, maybe it tastes better when you are a girl. It tastes ... well different i guess. If you like incredibly sour drinks, this one is for you. If you ever tried center shock and liked it (or you like giving it to other people) this drink is a must. Check it out, it even has no sugar and calories, e.g. you do not get fat.
<h3>Rating: 6.5 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thank you Melissa for buying me this drink from Holland.
