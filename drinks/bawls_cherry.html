<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
BAWLS comes in a red can with white &quot;balls&quot; all over. There is no real logo, just the text &quot;BAWLS Guarana Cherry&quot;. 
<h3>Taste</h3>
It smells like cherry BAWLS! Oh my god, it is so cherry and sweet. It is somewhat like coke cherry, but different. I really must say the first sip is much worse than the next ones. It got a lot of CO2 and the aftertaste is a bit sour. It probably kills everything in your mouth and you do not taste anything afterwards. The cherry taste is then not that bad anymore.
<h3>Overall</h3>
The first sip was really, really bad but if you drink on, it is not really too bad. When you wait a bit too long and drink again, the taste will be far too intense to really enjoy the drink. It was a &quot;different&quot; experience, but definitly a worth one.
<h3>Rating: 7.1 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks for this drinks goes to Christopher (Wooki) who bought me this drink for christmas, among other drinks i will review later on.
