    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    It is a white and siver can with red dots. They seem to go for simplicity. I kinda like the look though.
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    It really tastes like a great energy drink. It is not too sour or sweet, well actually it is really sweet but that is fine for me. The gummy bear taste is not really strong which is a good thing. That is the stuff i really like to drink. I really would consider it premium (they actually tasted it before selling it).
    <h3>Overall</h3>
    I like the look, the taste and the price. This is one rock solid energy drink, one of my favorites. Do not hesistate to buy it when you see it. Sure there quite some other energy drinks which are a lot cheaper, but this stuff surely tastes good.
    <h3>Rating: 8.9 of 10</h3>
