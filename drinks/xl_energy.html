<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
XL Energy is sold in a light and dark silver metallic blue can with a red cap. Of course it has the same CI as the other drinks, therefore no surprises here.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Well, it tastes like an energy drink. For me the drink tastes pretty ordinary, it even is too sweet and with quite some carbon dioxide. The sugary and gummy after taste even comes close to the drinks with replacement sugar (this is not a good sign). XL Energy is a pretty standard energy drink.
<h3>Overall</h3>
XL Energy is a pretty standard energy drink, which will probably do the job of keeping you awake while not tasting too horribly. It contains the allowed maximum of Caffeine and quite a lot of taurine which gives the drink the typical taste and even quite a lot of added Vitamins. It is ok, but really nothing special. Again the price is pretty high for a small can.
<h3>Rating: 7.4 of 10</h3>

Thanks goes to Melissa!
