<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
This time is not a can, but a see-through bottle with a silver-colored cap. The label has a bull with muscle arms(wtf?) and lightning on a red and black background. The drink itself is something between red and purple.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Oh my god, this is so... berry'... It smells so strong like these berry gummy bears. This is so sweet... geez. This that  same artificial berry taste you might know. It is just waaay too strong, i do not really like it.
<h3>Overall</h3>
It looks cheap, it tastes cheap, but the overall price is average. It is way too sweet to be enjoyable. It might not even be worth a try, but when you are a collector like me, it is still a must-drink :P.
<h3>Rating: 5.0 of 10</h3>
