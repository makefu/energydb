<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a black/grey can with a yellow M like the whole Monster series. The slogan is Energy+Saft.
<h3>Taste</h3>
The first taste is like WTF? The second taste is BAAAAWWWHHH! I guess the taste should be something like pineapple but the after taste is incredibly intense. I cannot really describe what it tastes like, but it does NOT taste good. It is so sweet my jaw almost fell off. I hoped for something which reall
<h3>Overall</h3>
This drink is a real disappointment for me. I hoped for something which really tastes like juice and energy but this stuff is just sweet as hell. I sure as hell can NOT recommend this stuff. Go buy something which tastes better AND is cheaper than this from your local discounter.
<h3>Rating: 3.2 of 10</h3>
