<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
When the drink itself tastes so standard the only thing which may stand out is the can or bottle it comes in. Mask Wanted comes in a blue can with a stylized bandits mask at the front. The opener itself is red, which you do not see often these days. It got a label &quot;made in Austria&quot; which means it one of the better energy drinks, i guess?
All in all the can looks neat but is nothing out of ordinary, also pretty generic.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It got the smell of the genericore energy drink...And i guess it will taste genericore as well. And yep, totally generic. Of course this is not a bad thing, Mask Energy tastes like every other drink. I really like that it got a high amount of CO2 as well as the acidic taste! I must say i really prefer a standard taste before some fucked up own creation of an energy drink!
<h3>Overall</h3>
Well, one of THESE drinks, there are no real cons with that one. Taste is ok, can looks ok, this surely is nothing really special.
If you need the caffeine and sugar kick, and this drink is cheap where you are you probably cannot do anything wrong when buying this drink when you like the typical energy drink taste. Everyone else who hates the energy drink taste and is looking for some fruity flavor might want to check out Masks Fruity, but i haven't yet tried out that one. The can is pretty small (but normal size for energy drinks) and it might not contain enough caffeine for a very very long night (see 500ml cans like Relentless) if you are already used to consume large amounts of caffeine.
For an energy drink this one was not too expensive for buying it at a 24/7 shop. After doing some research i found that you can probably buy this drink in Germany in some EDEKA supermarket (which is a franchise in Germany) for half the price.
The drink is good, i can recommend it.
