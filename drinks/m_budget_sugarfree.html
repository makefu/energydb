<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It comes in a very cheap looking white and green can with the word &quot;migros&quot; all over it. The &quot;sugarfree&quot; inferer badge is light blue to make it look more &quot;light&quot;. It has the Budget M logo at the front and even has the price at the front (swiss Fr. 0.85).
<h3>Taste</h3>
Smells like every other energy drink. The inital taste is a lot like every drink, but the after taste is very bitter. At the end the replacement sugar taste tortures your taste buds. I really really hate that taste. Even though it will have no  calories, it really kills the joy of drinking. Without that it might tastes better (or more like every energy drink).
<h3>Overall</h3>
The sugarfree (aka replacement sugar) taste really kills my mood. Without it the drink might even taste better (or simply more like an ordinary energy drink). Good news, there is the pure-sugar version still in my fridge waiting to be reviewed. Even though this drink is sugar free and does not have any calories, it is also lacking of the main ingredient necessary to provide you with the energy you actually expect. Considering it is bought in swizerland it is not really expensive,. Thats why my expectations weren't too high either. I hope the real sugar version tastes better.
<h3>Rating: 6.5 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Thanks goes to Thorsten Schoog who provided me with all these great (*cough* or not so great*cough*) energy drinks directly from Swizerland.
