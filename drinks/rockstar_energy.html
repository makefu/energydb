<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Black can with golden star at the front. It actually looks pretty cool.
<h3>Taste</h3>
When taking the first sip it is very sparkling, then becomes a bit sour and starts the taste very sweet. The gummy bear taste starts far behind in the palate. The aftertaste is typically very sweet. 
<h3>Overall</h3>
This tastes no other than cheap energy drinks, has typical tastes and overall does not taste like anything special. There are better drinks out there. I just saw at the website that they have like a dozen other tastes, so there might be the chance one of them is really good.
<h3>Rating: 7.3 of 10</h3>
