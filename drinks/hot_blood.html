<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can itself looks really really cool i must say. It is golden with the black text and the red "heart". The heart is actually a cut-out of the two "o"'s in the name, pretty neat. Hot Blood looks "special", like some canned prosecco drink. When filled in a glass the fluid looks whitey greenish, like some ISO drink.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Most whey energy drinks i drank were pretty decent, i hope the best for this one as well. It smells at least like an ordinary drink, typical sweet gummy smell. The taste itself decent i must say, not especially great. It tastes like most decent energy drinks, has a "special" flavor which does not really fit to the energy drink taste, probably this is the whey taste i cannot really tell. Besides that the taste is not more than "o.k."
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is a whey-energy drink, meaning it contains at least 51% whey. This makes the drink no-desposit here in Germany. The taste is not great, the looks are great. I might not buy this drink again for myself but
I would buy it  just for the looks for a friend as present. Really too bad the can is pretty small for the price.
