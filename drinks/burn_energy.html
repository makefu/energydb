    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h3>Look</h3>
    Black can with a flame at the front. Does more look like chili drink than energy drink.
    <h3>Taste</h3>
    It tastes like every energydrink very sweet. Instead of having an overwhelming gummy bear taste, this stuff is more like a berry drink. It is somewhat sour, has lots of CO2 and is very sparking, which is, in this case, a good thing. I really like it, this can be considered a `premium` energy drink! I really like the berry aftertaste.
    <h3>Overall</h3>
    It is from the Coca Cola Company, and they did everything right when mixing this drink. It is one of my favorite energy drinks, even though i only have drank it once in Milan. Only downer is the pretty costy price tag.
    <h3>Rating: 8.9 of 10</h3>
