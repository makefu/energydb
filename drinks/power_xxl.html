<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can of Power XXL looks reeeeally cheap. The logo is the &quot;POWER XXL&quot; text together with a pair of eyes staring at you pretty similar to the Jimmy Wales' Wikipedia campaign. Additionally all the &quot;cool&quot; slogans are on it  like &quot;TASTE THE BIG POWER&quot; and &quot;look into my eyes!&quot;.This is really cheesy.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Power XXL smells pretty genericore but the first sip is... kinda different. It is pretty sour but also really sweet. It seems like the taste changes over the time of drinking. Of course it has the typical gummy bear taste and all but it got different nuances in the sweet and sour level. With enough CO2 i can honestly say that this drink does not disappoints.
<h3>Overall</h3>
POWER XLL taste pretty ok, the look is really stupid. The price is too expensive for an average 250ml energy drink.It also only contains a thenth (30mg) of taurine compared to other energy drinks. This drink is not &quot;great&quot; but also does not really disappoints.
<h3>Rating: 6.3 of 10</h3>
