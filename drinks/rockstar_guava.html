<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
Like all Rockstar drinks it comes in a half liter can with a big golden star at the front. I really like this style. This can is purple with a golden top. Maybe because it should look somewhat tropical (thats at least what the name suggests).
<h3>Taste</h3>
The taste is similar to the Monster Ripper, but it is both barely as sweet and disgusting as that drink. It tastes somewhat like pineapple but i am actually not really sure what it "should" be. I guess it is guava, but i never actually ate or drank this fruit. The taste is really not too sweet for my taste. I am really sure it is only drinkable when it is cold, otherwise the taste may fall over to MAXIMUM sweetness.
<h3>Overall</h3>
I like it much better than most of the Rockstar Energy Drinks because it is only sweet, not OMGWTF sweet.I can recommend this drink, even though it is not 100 percent my taste. Check it out.
<h3>Rating: 7.6 of 10</h3>
