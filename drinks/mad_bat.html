<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
It is a light-red and silver PAPER can with a small "mb" logo at the front. The can is made similar to the Tetra Pack packaging but in cylinder form. The opener is a small tin foil piece which you pull off to drink. On the can there is a "since 1999" and my only question is HOW did they survive for 11 years with such disgusting drink? But read more below.
<h3>Taste</h3>
EWWWW... wtf seriously? This drink is just disgusting. It tastes something between gummy and plastic.  Has someone from the producer ever tasted it before selling? obviously NOT! It just tastes WRONG, probably something between toilet cleaner and dish soap.
<h3>Overall</h3>
I must say, this drink is really special. But special in a way you probably do not want your product be. This drink is, for now a really long time, the WORST energy drink i drank. Why, Mad Bat?  Why so disgusting?  The can says "be awake", well i am now awake but not because of the caffein but because of rage! Even if the drink would be free it would not be worth the price. My guess is that this drink is currently used for torture in afghanistan or korea. I HATE YOU bat beverages , i want my money AND the time back i needed to write this rant!
<h3>Rating: 0.1 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
What the fuck were you thinking Christopher when you bought me 20(!) of these AFTER i reviewed this drink? Thank you very much...
