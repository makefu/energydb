<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The can of big shock orange looks pretty nice, quite possibly influenced by Monster or Rockstar energy drink. The 500ml can has an orange ribbon at the top, the logo in big letters and at the lower half of the can a stylish logo. The logo is a disco bowl with headphones on(?) and the lower ribbon is made of cheering people. I must say the design is pretty neat.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Wow, big shock orange really smells like orange juice. It smells even more orangy like Fanta. Hell, it even tastes like Miranda or Fanta. It is a bit more sour though.There is pretty much no `energy` taste in it whatsoever. It does not have a damn lot CO2 but it is not really necessary. This drink is really delicious! Even people who hate the energy drink taste quite possibly like this drink.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Big Shock seems to be a Czech energy drink based on the czech url and because it is the primary language on the contents description. This might even be the czech counterpart to the big Energy drinks Brands available like Monster or Rockstar. The "Orange" Big Shock is really tasty and in my oppinion tastes better than most of the big brands' flavours. It also has quite a bunch of the good stuff mixed in like a bunch of vitamins and caffeine maxed out. I can highly recommend this one if you have the chance to drink it.
<h3>Rating: 8.5 of 10</h3>
