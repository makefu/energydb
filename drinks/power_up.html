<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
A silver can with the Power up logo on it.Really looks somewhat cheap. Re-Review: The can is Silver with blue and red labels. There is a stick-figure weigh lifter at the front next to the Power Up logo which is blue with white Text and in the background a dark blue star and the rutherford model symbol(⚛). In the bottom left corner there are two screw labels on the can. The designer probably though "What looks cool and strong?" and that is the outcome. And yeah, it still looks pretty cheap to me.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It tastes really sweet with a very strong gummy taste. It surely is not the best E-drink i drank until now. Re-Review: Well i must say it still is really sweet, but actually it does not taste too bad. Power Up does not have a strong after taste (but still has the typical gummy bear taste), but quite a lot of CO2. I am drinking this one ice cold and i am pretty sure it is not great a bit warmer but that is fine for me. You can compare it to a 'not that good' version of Lions Energizer. 
<h3>Overall</h3>
A Cheap, mediocre tasting drink.Re-Rewiev: It has been quite some time since i reviewed 'Power Up EXTRA STRONG ENERGY DRINK' (i really do not know what the designers of energy drinks have with all caps descriptions...). I am doing the review again because the old one is kind of bland and inexpressive. After retrying Power Up i think the rating i gave for power up was not wrong, probably a bit too low. I can recommend this drink if you want a quick and kind of inexpensive refreshment.
<h3>Rating: 7.1 of 10</h3>
