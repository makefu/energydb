<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The energy Drink comes in a blue plastic bottle with a silver label. At the front there is a (*surprise*) rocket with a red background on it. It does not look expensive (spoiler, it isn't) but the artist surely haven't put much effort in designing the packaging. It surely should not attract energy drink connoisseurs like me, but party people who want to pimp their cheap vodka to make it 'kick' more.
<h3>Taste</h3>
Energy Rocket smells somewhat like plastic and gummy bears. The really sweet odor is not really the greatest thing i ever smelt. The taste is, as expected, not good but average in terms of energy drinks. Energy Rocket has this plastic after taste combined with a very sugary taste. You can drink it very fast because this drink does not have an awful lot of CO2 inside. This drink might work as a mix-in but not pure, at least not for me. I changed the rating from 8 to 6 after retrying this drink. It seems my scale has changed after drink energy drinks like the 'schwarze dose' or 'relentless energy'.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Ok, here is a 'very late' review of the Energy Rocket. I bought this drink the first time last year but never had the vigor to review if completely. Energy Rocket is one of the 'cheapo' energy drinks you can buy at big market centers. The drink does not taste great, like most cheap drinks, but you at least have the chance to get your caffeine kick. The bottle looks cheap, the etiquette label too, but one will most likely not buy this drink because it is something special. 
<h3>Rating: 6.0 of 10</h3>
