<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
The drink comes in a silver can with orange and black label. The "ACTION" logo goes from bottom to top. At the back you have 3 pictograms, one a jumping person, second a fucking molecule(wtf?!?) and third a head with gears inside. I have no idea what they want to point out with that. There is another label which says "get your fire" which makes even less sense. Overall i kinda like the style and probably i am only nitpicking.
<h3>Taste</h3>
It smells a lot like the "average" energy drink. At first it really tastes not too bad, but the after taste is really really sweet and tastes a lot like gummy bear taste. It is a bit sour, but still does not have enough CO2. The whey inside the drink makes a weird taste on the tongue and teeth. My friends say it taste like red bull just with bad after taste. In my oppinion the first taste is not as sweet as red bull.
<h3>Overall</h3>
Actually this drink is not too bad, besides the film created on the tongue. I am really a fan of these whey drink anyway. It could need some more CO2 as well.
<h3>Rating: 7.6 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
Big thanks goes to Momo for providing me with the source. His comment on the energy drink is "Hoden Reiben". Earlier Misa bought me this drink from Mueller Stuttgart for which i am really grateful for.
