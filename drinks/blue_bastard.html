<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
This drinks comes right from Holland, therefore most texts are dutch. It comes in a black can with a "Blue Bastard" dog at the cover. The can says it got "an awfully 'cool' taste" but i am not quite convinced yet. At first sight i haven't spotted the text it got CO2 but i hope for the best. O.k lets give it a shot
<h3>Taste</h3>
It is a bit sour and got very few CO2 inside. Still, it does not taste too bad. The drink is sweet, but not too sweet and it is quite drinkable. This taste is relevant to my interest.
<h3>Overall</h3>
All in all, this drink tastes pretty good. In respect to the price, it is really neat. I probably won't have the chance to drink it again, but if you live in Holland, you might be lucky to find it in your local supermarket.
<h3>Rating: 8.1 of 10</h3>
<h3>Tribute:</h3>
I want to thank Melissa for buying me this drink on her trip to Holland.I will always remember the time we drank and reviewed the "Blue Bastard" in Hamburg.
