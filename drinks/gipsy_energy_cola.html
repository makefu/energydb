<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Look</h3>
A silver and red can with the Gipsy energy cola logo on it. It really looks cheap to me. But one cannot imagine that some can like that tastes like shit!
<h3>Taste</h3>
The first sip is like... mh ... 1 second later UAAARGHHHH!!!! Wtf seriously? what were they thinking? This is BY far the worst cola stuff i ever drank. It tastes so much like some weird chemical experiment. Thats how i would imagine toilet cleaner tastes like. Have they ever tasted it before?
<h3>Overall</h3>
This is the WORST! Never try it, just trust me. Never EVER buy this stuff. Even though it costs onl 59 cent, you will regret it!
<h3>Rating: 1.0 of 10</h3>
